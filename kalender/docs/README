Common Problems
---------------

Problem:
I login but I get a page that looks as if I hadn't logged in.

Solution:
It is likely that your session files are not stored in a persistent location.
Try changing the value of your session.save_path in your php.ini, or if you
do not have access to such things add a line like this to your config.php:

        ini_set('session.save_path', '/tmp/persistent/phpcalendar');
