Q: How do I fit the calendar into the theme of my website?
A: The only recommended way is if you can use PHP for the page you wish to
   put the calendar on. You need to include the file "includes/setup.php"
   at the very beginning of the page. You should include the CSS in the
   header of the page. You need to include the file "includes/embed.php"
   where you would like the calendar to show up. Here is an example page:

<?php require_once 'includes/setup.php'; ?>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example Embedded Calendar</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.php">
  </head>
  <body>
    <?php require 'includes/embed.php'; ?>
  </body>
</html>

Q: How do I allow HTML in the descriptions of events?
A: Read and follow comments in the function parse_desc() in
   includes/calendar.php

Q: How do I get the links for translations to appear?
A: You need to build the .mo files for the languages you want. To do this, go
   into the directory for each language you want (ex. locale/de/LC_MESSAGES)
   and run: msgfmt messages.po
   I have no experience with this in Windows. Read the manual for gettext for
   more information.
