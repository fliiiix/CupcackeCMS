Only versions 0.8 and newer are supported.

You should backup your database and your installation before attempting any 
upgrades.

Either copy your config file to the new directory or use the update.php to 
specify the location. The update is a slightly manual process. If you are 
updating from version 0.8, open update08.php in your web browser. This will 
update you partway. If you're updating from 0.8 and you did the previous step 
or you're updating from 0.9 through 1.0, open update10.php in your web browser.
